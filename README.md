Monty Bytecode Interpreter. This interpreter was built in the C language and is compliant with `ISO90`, `ISO99`, & `ISO11`. It reads Monty bytecode files of any extension (preferably `.m` although it doesn't matter), and interprets the opcodes contained.
A language interpreter made in the C programming language to manage stacks and queues (LIFO and FIFO). The aim is to interpret Monty bytecodes files. Monty is a language that aims to close the gap between scripting and programming languages.
A stack is an Abstract Data Type (ADT), commonly used in most programming languages
This feature makes it LIFO data structure. LIFO stands for Last-in-first-out. Here, the element which is placed (inserted or added) last, is accessed first. In stack terminology, insertion operation is called PUSH operation and removal operation is called POP operation.
